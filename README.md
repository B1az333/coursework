# Coursework KPI 2021 May (frontend + backend) 

My very first large-scale work, which contains both the front-end part and the back-end. 

Based on the task, a website with a database was made. Where the client can find a worker for some construction purpose. An architect can find a job for himself and join the project he wants. And the managers run the whole thing. 

I must say, not perfect work, but i tried:D Then I was very inexperienced. 

This coursework was completed in May 2021.
